    	<p>MORE ABOUT THIS PROJECT: <br> During the current health crisis, collaboration, togetherness and positivity are all hard to find. We want to allow our users to experience a blast to Y2K, a time where we were young and found joy in discovering new objects, listening to new things and just having fun. But also give our user the space to experience this with others, who also remember this time and these objects allowing them to reminisce on the past together but also create new compositions  together using the objects and sounds of Y2K.</p>
